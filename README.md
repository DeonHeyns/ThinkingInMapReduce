This is a collection of stand-alone files that introduce a map-reduce style of programming.
The code is written in scala (and was tested on scala 2.9.2). You should be able to run each file
with `scala filename.scala`.

Included is a toy implementation of MapReduce that is very similar to the Hadoop model, but only
included so that you can try executing your "job".
